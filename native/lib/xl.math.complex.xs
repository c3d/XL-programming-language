COMPLEX[real, angle] as module with

COMPLEX[real] as module is COMPLEX[real, real]
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   A generic module for the case of floating-point numbers
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   In that case, we can use the same type by default for the angle type


COMPLEX as module is
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   A non-generic module offering a generic type
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   This makes it easier to instantiate the generic modules
